# gsub 替换

```ruby
"hello".gsub(/[aeiou]/, '*')                  #=> "h*ll*"
"hello".gsub(/([aeiou])/, '<\1>')             #=> "h<e>ll<o>"
"hello".gsub(/./) {|s| s.ord.to_s + ' '}      #=> "104 101 108 108 111 "
"hello".gsub(/(?<foo>[aeiou])/, '{\k<foo>}')  #=> "h{e}ll{o}"
'hello'.gsub(/[eo]/, 'e' => 3, 'o' => '*')    #=> "h3ll*"
```

[**$1** and **\1** in Ruby](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/288573/1-and-1-in-ruby)

\1 is a backreference which will only work in the same `sub` `gsub` method call, e.g.:

```ruby
"foobar".sub(/foo(.*)/, '\1\1') # => "barbar"
```

$1 is a global variable which can be used in later code:

```ruby
if "foobar" =~ /foo(.*)/ then 
  puts "The matching word was #{$1}"
end
```

Output:

```ruby
"The matching word was bar"
# => nil
```

Used in `case ; when ;  end` feel better.

```ruby
str = "foobar"

case str
when /foo(.*)/
  puts "The matching word was #{$1}"
end
```

Output:

```ruby
The matching word was bar
# => nil
```
